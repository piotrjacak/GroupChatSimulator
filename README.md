# Group Chat Simulator

## About
This is the project for the course "Programming in Graphical Environment". It contains two applications, the first one is a client, second one is a server. Simulator allows to start a TCP server 
session on any IP address and port with a authorization key. Server can disconnect clients and send them messages. Clients can connect to the server and exchange messages. Everything is logged in
server logs section. 

## To do
Most of the described features do well, but work on this program is still in progress. To do:
* add disconnecting feature that works properly,
* add feature that allows server to disconnect any client,
* make chat bubble resizable
